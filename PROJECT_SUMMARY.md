## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| React Native | Cross-platform mobile framework |
| Expo | Development platform & tooling |
| TypeScript | Type-safe development |
| Expo Router | File-based navigation |
| Axios | HTTP client for API calls |
| Expo Location | Native location services |
| Lucide React Native | Icon library |
| React Native Reanimated | Smooth animations |
| Expo Linear Gradient | Gradient backgrounds |

## 🌐 API Integration

**OpenWeather API Endpoints Used:**
- `/weather` - Current weather data
- `/forecast` - 5-day/3-hour forecast

**Data Retrieved:**
- Temperature (current, feels like, min, max)
- Weather conditions and descriptions
- Humidity, pressure, visibility
- Wind speed and direction
- Cloudiness percentage
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Weather icons

## 📱 Screen Breakdown

### Home Screen (index.tsx)
- Displays current weather for user's location
- Shows detailed weather metrics:
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Pressure
  - Visibility
  - Cloudiness
  - Sunrise/Sunset times
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Dynamic background based on weather
- Error handling with retry option

### Forecast Screen (forecast.tsx)
- 5-day weather forecast cards
- Daily high/low temperatures
- Hourly forecast (next 8 hours)
- Weather conditions for each period
- Scrollable horizontal hourly view
- Location display

### Search Screen (search.tsx)
- City name search input
- Recent searches list (last 5 cities)
- Full weather card for searched location
- Additional info (country, coordinates)
- Loading states during search
- Error handling for invalid cities

## 🎨 Design Features

### Color Scheme
- Dynamic gradients based on weather conditions:
  - Clear: Blue to gold
  - Cloudy: Gray tones
  - Rainy: Dark blue shades
  - Thunderstorm: Very dark blues
  - Snow: White to light blue
  - Mist/Fog: Gray to light blue

### Animations
- Subtle background animations
- Skeleton loading animations
- Smooth transitions between states
- Pull-to-refresh indicators

### Typography
- Clear hierarchy with varied font weights
- Readable sizes for all content
- Proper contrast for accessibility

## 🔐 Permissions & Configuration

### iOS
- Location permission with usage description
- Configured in `app.json`

### Android
- Fine and coarse location permissions
- Configured in `app.json`

### Environment Variables
- API key stored securely in `.env`
- Not committed to version control
- Template provided in `.env.example`

## 📊 Performance Considerations

- Efficient API calls (only when needed)
- Pull-to-refresh instead of auto-refresh
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
- Lazy loading of forecast data
- Cached recent searches

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Get OpenWeather API key
3. Create `.env` file with API key
4. Run: `npx expo start`
5. Test on simulator or device
